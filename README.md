# SLS Express App

Trying to set up an sls express app that can be used in prod. A few things that would be super useful:

- [ ] A way to run the app locally
- [ ] CI/CD
- [ ] aws-sdk not taking up dependency space
- [ ] A way to deploy multiregion


### CI/CD

[This Guide](https://github.com/serverless/github-action) is useful for setting up CI/CD.
